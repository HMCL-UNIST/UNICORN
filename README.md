## Installation
We provide an race stack installation guide.\
[INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md).\
Also, you must read this file carefully.\
[READYTORUN.md](./READYTORUN.md).
## Getting started

After installation, the car (or the simulation environment) is ready to be tested. For examples on how to run the different modules on the car, refer to the [`stack_master` README](./stack_master/README.md). 

## Acknowledgement
This project would not be possible without the use of multiple great open-sourced code bases as listed below:
This project benefited greatly from the open-sourced code provided by [ForzaETH](https://github.com/ForzaETH/race_stack), 
particularly in areas ranging from installation methods to the overall autonomous racing architecture. We would also like to acknowledge the use of other excellent open-source projects listed below:
